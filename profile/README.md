# Loustik Studio

Loustik Studio is a student game studio created in 2023, to work on our graduation project.\
We are happy and excited to work on our first game "Sense" ❤️


## Sense

**Sense** is a 3rd-person adventure game. \
\
Wake up in a dark place, with no memory, and above all, without your 5 senses.\
Fight increasingly powerful enemies, and try to recover your senses, in this world that seems so strange to you.\
Throughout this epic journey, you'll be filled with doubt and sadness, but to survive you'll have to ask yourself the right questions, to move beyond your lack of understanding.
## Roadmap

These features are our goals for our degree.\
